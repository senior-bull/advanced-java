## Main concepts

Key ideas:
* Contrary to what some might think, functional programming isnâ€™t the opposite of object-oriented programming
* One major difference between imperative programming and FP is that in FP there are
  no side effects. In other words, side effects
  will be delayed and applied separately.
* Throwing an exception is a side effect
* In other words, the output of a functional program
  must depend only on its argument

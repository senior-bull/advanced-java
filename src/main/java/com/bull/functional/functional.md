## Main concepts

Key ideas:
* Contrary to what some might think, functional programming isn’t the opposite of object-oriented programming
* One major difference between imperative programming and FP is that in FP there are
  no side effects. In other words, side effects
  will be delayed and applied separately.
* Throwing an exception is a side effect
* In other words, the output of a functional program
  must depend only on its argument
* if-else and for-loops are not prefereable

#### Basics

* This special kind of function, taking functions as its arguments and returning functions, is called a *higher-order function (HOF)*
* Part of the beauty of functional programming is in finding every small element that
  can be abstracted and reused. After you get used to this way of thinking, you’ll start
  seeing patterns everywhere and you’ll want to abstract them.
